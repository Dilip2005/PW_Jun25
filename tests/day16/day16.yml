Geo location:
 is used when you want to simulate a browserâ€™s location 
 (latitude and longitude) so that the website thinks you are browsing from that place.

This is useful for testing:

Websites or apps that depend on location-based services

Geo-specific content (e.g., weather apps, maps, delivery availability)

Region-based features or restrictions (e.g., currency, language, search results)
